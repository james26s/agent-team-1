    "# Auto Generated Agent Chat: Collaborative Task Solving with Multiple Agents and Human Users\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation. Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate an application involving multiple agents and human users to work together and accomplish a task. `AssistantAgent` is an LLM-based agent that can write Python code (in a Python coding block) for a user to execute for a given task. `UserProxyAgent` is an agent which serves as a proxy for a user to execute the code written by `AssistantAgent`. We create multiple `UserProxyAgent` instances which can represent different human users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen requires `Python>=3.8`. To run this notebook example, please install:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pyautogen\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Simplicity**: While your design sounds creative and detailed, it might be too complex to be easily recognizable, especially if the heart is made up of small musical notes and footballs. You might want to simplify some elements to ensure the design is clear and impactful even from a distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Color Scheme**: You didn't mention the color scheme. Choosing the right colors is crucial for the design to stand out. You might want to use contrasting colors for the silhouette and the background. Also, consider the color of the t-shirt itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Typography**: The phrase 'Love is in the Air' and the date they started dating should be in a font that's easy to read. The font style should also match the overall design. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Size and Placement**: Make sure the design is not too big or too small on the t-shirt. The placement of the design should also be considered. Usually, the design should be centered on the chest area for the front design and upper back for the back design.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Relevance**: Ensure that the design elements are relevant to the people wearing it. If Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not a couple, the design might confuse people. \n",
